If you pyuic4 -x mainApplication.ui -o output.py on the ui file, you will generate the output file that is shown in the directory. However, the output file will not print the python.jpg image shown. This is because the current output.py file was modified and placed in this directory to show how to attach an image to a qt4 image.
