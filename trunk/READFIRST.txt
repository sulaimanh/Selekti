Building the UI:
To build the ui as a standalone executable run the "pyinstaller main.py" command. 
After the files have finished building correctly, go to the dist folder and you will be able to run the main.exe from in there. However, the logo will not be displayed unless you create a symbolic link to the trunk folder and run the application from the trunk directory instead. (Make a shortcut to the trunk directory)
